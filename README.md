## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease worldwide, and early prediction can help in proactive management and prevention of complications. Machine learning techniques offer promising approaches to predict diabetes risk based on individual health data.

This project explores the development and evaluation of machine learning models for diabetes prediction using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of individuals with various features including age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, and other relevant medical attributes. The target variable is the presence or absence of diabetes.
