## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease worldwide, and early prediction can help in proactive management and prevention of complications. Machine learning techniques offer promising approaches to predict diabetes risk based on individual health data.

This project explores the development and evaluation of machine learning models for diabetes prediction using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of individuals with various features including age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, and other relevant medical attributes. The target variable is the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download IPYNB
2. upload the IPYNB to Google Colab
3. Download the dataset
4. upload to Google Colab
5. Run Each cell


## Usage

After installing the dependencies and downloading the dataset, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Explore the dataset: Use Google Colab or any preferred IDE to open and explore the dataset (`diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`).

2. Preprocess the data: Preprocess the dataset as needed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, etc.

3. Train models: Train machine learning models using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.

4. Evaluate models: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

5. Predictions: Use the trained models to make predictions on new data or test set and evaluate their performance.
